It represents the idea of creating a safe and welcoming space for different ways of thinking.\n\nThe app's mascot, Leggy, was intentionally designed with a square head and a round body to symbolize coexistence and integration between different minds. The square and the circle represent two different ways of functioning, neurotypical and neurodivergent, living together, not to become the same, but to grow side by side.\n\nI strongly believe in creating tools that combine understanding, accessibility, and creativity.")
